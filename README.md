# task-board

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I wanted to create a task manager that would take new tasks and order them in separate rows based on a timeline for completeness. New tasks would color code (red, yellow, or white) each task by the urgency of their timeline. Tasks persist on refresh, and should be able to be dragged and dropped between rows. I've been successful at using a modal to prompt for a new task and the tasks persist in local storage. However, I haven't been able to get the color coding. Tasks are draggable, but I've run out of time working on making them stick. I'm learning a lot about using JQuery and the extra practice with js functions is very helpful. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
